# DRY Principle & Fundamentals (Pt. 2)

In the previous part, we learned about breaking down problems into two main challenges: ***Repetition*** & ***Complexity***. In dealing with repetition-based challenges, we saw that loops or iterative solutions were effective at solving these problems. With complex problems, we saw that using helper functions were effective at breaking these problems into manageable smaller problems.

Today, we going to focus on ***Separation of Concerns***. This is an effective and important strategy for implementing DRY well. It is the idea that every unit of your problem can be split into either it's own variable or function. This is exactly what we do with dealing with complex problems already; however, we want to make it a point to solve most problems with this method. Why? Because most problems are more complex than repetitive, even if they involve a lot of loops. 

#### Key Vocab: ***Separation of Concerns***

## Finishing Questions

* What is ***separation of concerns*** in your own words?
* What are the purposes of all these definitions that we have learned so far?
* Are these hard-set principles? For example, is there a clear rule to when to use ***separation of concerns*** (helper functions or declaring variables).
