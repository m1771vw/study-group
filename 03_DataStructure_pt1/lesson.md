# Data Structure: Abstract & JS Built-ins

**Goal:** Think about data structures as tools to solve everyday problems rather than abstract computer science ideas

What are real life examples methods, structures, or systems for organizing people or things in life?

#### People

Imagine a to-go restaurant, where you must place an order by catching the attention of an employee. It doesn't matter who got there first. This to-go restaurant would probably be chaotic (as some are that operate like this), and depending on the culture, it also might turn off customers by lacking a sense of "fairness". In the US and a lot of countries, people have a strong sense of fairness based on first-come, first-serve. As a result, many places operate via a line or a queue. This means that the first people that come in are the first people that leave. 

#### Subways / Metros

What are some useful features about metros? Probably that they can go to other metro stations and that they go often. Let's focus on that first idea and elaborate on the importance of metro lines connecting to other lines. Inherently, a metro line is just that, a line. This means that there is only a next station and a previous station from a single station. However, this is not a very useful if you want to go somewhere not on this line. As a result, metros connect multiple lines at transfer stations. This creates a grid or graph of metro stations. 

## Finishing Questions

* What drives the use of a specific data structure in real life and also in programming?
* Are there ***better*** data structures than other?
* Give a programming example of each of the real-life example.
* Why do we have data structures?
* Why would we use a ***dictionary*** in programming? In real life?
